Python Byte Code to Javascript compiler
---------------------------------------

* I [got really excited about this idea](http://nick.zoic.org/art/python/browser/)
and hammered out a compiler.  It is a work in progress, but I figured I'd chuck it
on github in case anyone found it interesting.

* There are probably better approaches, such as using [inspect.getsource](http://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html#retrieving-source-code), and I'd like to come back and look at it some day.

* I've come to terms with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) in the meantime, partly because it has
gotten better and partly because my understanding of Javascript has improved.
